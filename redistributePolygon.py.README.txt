Known Issues: 

The intersecting_polygons layer can have growth model data joined to it
multiple times. for example, you will find POP_2016_2017, and POP_2021_2022
fields. This doesn't seem to impact on the final results, but this issue
should be fully understood before and / or fixed before this tool is used on
other areas.

In the case of Lavarack Barracks, GMZ 375 has a high employment EP, but total
of only 15 properties. This causes the pump station catchment covering
Lavarack Barracks is quite under assigned in EPs, also, the adjacent PS
catchment also partially covering Lavarack Barracks is possibly overestimated.
This issue will be difficult to address. It is recommended that catchments be
manually checked if GMZs are only partially covered by the joining layer (PS
catchments in this case).
