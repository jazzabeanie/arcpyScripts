# Created on: 2016-08-01 13:00:00
#
# Usage: redistributePolygon <redistribution_layer> <target_layer> <distribution_method> <output_filename> <growthmodel_csv>
# Description: 
# This model splits the target polygon based on intersection with the redistribution polygon. It then joins the split polygon back together based on a common attibute that was carried over from the redistribution polygon. it takes the argument:
#  - redistribution_layer: the areas that the target feature should be rejoined to, eg, Sewer Pump Station Catchments
#  - target_layer: the layer with the data that need to be redistributed, eg, Growth Model Zones.
#  - distribution_method: The method by which the values in the target_layer should be distibuted when split. Initally this tool will be built with only distribution by area, but in the future this may include number of properties or percentage of undeveloped land.
#  - output_filename:
#  - growthmodel_csv: table containing growth model data to be joined
# 
# The Manhole number is given by the Upstream Manhole Number field in the GravityMain. This field is passed to the PropertyConnectionPoints layer by selecting any PropertyConnectionPoints that aren't intersecting with a service line. The Manhole Number is then passed to the property by a spatial join.
